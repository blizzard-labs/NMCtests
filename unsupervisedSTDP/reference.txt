# * Leaky Integrate and Fire Neuron Model ------------------------------------

    tau * dV/dt = (e_rest - V) + g_e * (e_exc - V) + g_i * (e_inh - V)

        e_inh     equillibrium poteintal for inhibitory synapses
        g_e       conductance of excitatory synapses
        g_i       conductance for inhibitory synapses
        tau       time constant which is longer for excitatory than inhibitory neurons
        V         membrane voltage
        t         time steps

    V > v_thresh: V = v_reset    
        v_thresh  membrane threshold
        v_reset   initial membrane potential
        
        Model describing firing event which is followed by refractory period
    
# * Conductance-based Synapse Model ------------------------------------------

    g_e += w
        g_e       conductance for excitatory synapses
        
        Instantaneous conductance update to excitatory synapse following presynaptic spike
    
    g_i += w
        g_i       conductance for inhibitory synapses
        
        Instantaneous conductance update to inhibitory synapse following presynaptic spike
    
    tau_g_e * d(g_e)/dt = -g_e
        tau_g_e   time constant of an excitatory postsynaptic potential
        g_e       conductance of excitatory synapses
        t         time steps
        
        Model describing exponential decay of conductance to excitatory synapse with lack of spike

        tau_g_e   time constant of an excitatory postsynaptic potential
        g_e       conductance of excitatory synapses
        t         time steps
        
        Model describing exponential decay of conductance to inhibitory synapse with lack of spike
        
# * Network Architecture -----------------------------------------------------

    Input Layer : 28 x 28 neurons (one neuron per pixel)
        Fed as a poisson spike train which are then fed to excitatory of second layer
        
    Processing Layer : Variable number of excitatory neurons and an equal number of inhibitory
        Excitatory neurons are connected in a 1:1 fashion with inhibitory neurons (lateral inhibition)
        Maximum conductance of inhibitory to excitatory fixed at 10 nS
        
# * Unsupervised STDP Learning -----------------------------------------------

    x_pre += 1
        x_pre     presynaptic trace
        
        Response to everytime a presynaptic spike arrives at a synapse
        
    #! Include exponential decay of trace equation 
    
    delta_w = learn_r * (x_pre - x_tar) * (w_max - w)^m
        delta_w   change in synaptic weight
        learn_r   learning rate
        x_pre     presynaptic trace
        x_tar     target value of presynaptic trace at the moment of a postsynaptic spike
        w_max     maximum synaptic weight
        w         synaptic weight

# * Adaptive Membrane Threshold (Homeostatis) --------------------------------

    v_thresh += theta
        v_thresh  membrane potential threshold
        theta     homeostatis constant
        
        Model determining membrane threshold
        
    theta += 1
        theta     homeostatis constant
        
        Increase of theta with each spike
        
    #! Include exponential decay of theta equation
        Once the v_thresh is close to e_exc, it will fire less often until theta decreases

# * Input Encoding -----------------------------------------------------------
    Input is presented for 350 ms as Poisson-distributed spike trains
        Max pixel intensity of 255 is divided by 4 resulting in firing rates (0, 63.75Hz)
    IF excitatory neurons in sencond layer fire less than 5 spikes in 350 ms, maximimum input firing rate is increased by 32 Hz
